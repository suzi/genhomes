Three in the last 2 years I have used the painting division of Generation to do large, commercial exterior painting projects (office buildings and a retail center), to everyone's satisfaction. The projects were competitively bid so I know the pricing was good and the product knowledge was right on as well. Those jobs required coordination with the on-site tenants so they were not impacted in their business flow and I have always been able to trust Robert and his crews to work well with those outside elements. Our company has also used Robert for any number of tenant improvement jobs and the pricing is fair, work is kept to schedule, communication through the process is open, and the results were all that the landlords and tenants expected and more.

Excellent experience! Very professional design and construction recommendations. Excellent management and quality of sub-contractors. Very responsive to questions and concerns. Stayed on schedule. Supported and effectively fought for us when an issue with a supplier arose.

Project costs came in exactly to what was quoted. Change orders were handled very professionally and timely. Work quality was top notch. Overall I would recommend this contractor and I would use them again.

Robert and his team are absolutely amazing and were such a pleasure to work with! I would highly recommend them to anyone and we wouldn't want to work with anyone else on our next remodel or construction project

We hired Generation Homes to do a basic remodel of a home we purchased in Fresno while we lived in Maine. I met with them twice and then communicated via email and phone. New flooring, taking out a wet bar and replacing with a China Hutch, paint, remodel, a bathroom, new appliances, painted cabinets, new fireplaces with mantle, light textures and more. We were extremely pleased.

We couldn't be more pleased with Generation Homes' remodel of our bathroom. During the beginning stage, GH's designer, was helpful & patient in listening to my thoughts & providing ideas & options in establishing colors, style, textures & design of the bathroom that would fit us. They ordered everything before the work was started which made the construction time much shorter. Generation Homes scheduled and managed all of the sub-contractors to get the work done efficiently & in an orderly manner. They were there to make sure all of the work was done to the high standard of Generation Homes. Their timing & overseeing made this project run smoothly and meet the estimated completion of the project & with excellence. Generation Homes is a professional company that can be trusted to do the job right! Thank you Generation Homes!

Working with Generation Homes on the complete remodel of our two bathrooms was a great experience. They were accommodating to my schedule, determined my style preferences, and helped me select and coordinate the materials needed to make it all come together. Workers showed up when they said they would, and work progressed smoothly. There was also a time constraint due to my husbandâ€™s scheduled back surgery. The parts of the puzzle all came together and Generation Homes was able to finish the majority of the work before he returned home. This was such a positive experience compared to other contracted work we have had done in the past. I would not hesitate to contact Generation Homes for future home improvement projects. They delivered a high quality job and were a pleasure to work with.

Generation homes has done a bathroom/bedroom remodel as well as a recent kitchen/bath remodel in my home. They are wonderful to work with and have kept the completion of both projects on time!! There is an on-site contractor who monitors all work being done. Both the work ethic and friendliness of their subcontractors are awesome. The quality of work is outstanding and they make sure everything is done correctly. They provide a design coordinator who helps you to make the many important decisions regarding, design, colors, fixtures etc...that are necessary when going through a remodeling process. They are very helpful, creative and your biggest cheerleader through the entire event. I would highly recommend Generation Homes for either a remodel or a new construction project !!

We had excellent service from Genneration Homes. We received a contract with all expected costs. When there were unavoidable changes, we were given new costs to analyze and determine if we wanted to go forward. Also, all subs and contractors were always on time. Our remodel experience was a positive one. We would use Generations Homes in the future and recommend them to my friends and family.
<br>Sincerely,<br>

Dear Friends,
<br>
We have just completed the remodeling of our kitchen. Robert Wood of Generation Homes was our contractor. We found him very helpful in the early planning and throughout the entire process. His estimate of the total cost and guidance to specific sources for the components was accurate and cost saving.
<br>
When it came to Mr. Wood's selection of sub-contractors, we found them excellent and quite trustworthy. We highly recommend Generation Homes and Robert Wood. Come see our kitchen.
<br>

A great team to work with. They helped with all aspects of our project (a bathroom remodel) from design to execution. When problems came up, I was informed of the issue and given options and costs to fix. For example, a pony wall in the bathroom had dry rot. Generation let me know, gave me solutions that considered cost and design, and made it work. The bathroom still looks and performs great. I will hire them on my next job without question.

This is an unabashedly rave testimonial for the administrative and contracting staff of Generation Homes & Commercial, Fresno CA.
</p>
<p>
Approximately one year ago, Generation Homes took over responsibility for a major remolding and renovation project we had undertaken in San Francisco, CA. At the time Generation Homes "adopted" the refurbishing of our 120-year old four-story residence, costs were out of control, our previous contractor was at odds with the San Francisco Building Department, and the building's dry-rot, roofing, siding, plumbing, and electrical issues were daunting. We were at our wits' end.
</p>
<p>
Virtually commuting to San Francisco from Fresno, the Generation Homes personnel assessed and re-forecast a sensible budget for the makeover, recommended both structural relationship with the SF Building Department, and completed the entire project within the new budget and with the level of finished detail that far exceeded our expectations. Indeed, the finishing work has been described by neighbors as "stunning". As well, the work crews maintained excellent relations with our neighbors, no small accomplishment in a city where homes literally adjoin each other. And everything was completed on time.
</p>
<p>
It is hard for us to imagine a better building and home contracting organization than Generation Homes, and we would be pleased at any time, to elaborate on our wholly positive experiences working with the company.
